## Modelling exercise
Your task is to model one of the following:

* Netflix
* Instagram
* BBC News Website

1. Think about what database tables this site would need, and what relationships they would have to each other. Are they one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many?

2. You should have at least 5 tables represented in your diagram. But don't go crazy. Simplify, make an MVP of your chosen site.

3. You can just draw your diagrams and/or notes with pen and paper (take a photo for your repo). Alternatively you can use a tool like draw.io and submit the diagram you make.
