![alt text](https://github.com/DJMF2015/cc_homework/blob/master/week3/day03/music_collection_HW/music_collection.jpg)

- You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

- [x] Create and Save Artists

- [x] Create and Save Albums

- [x] All Artists/Albums

- [x] all the albums they have by an artist

- [x] Show the artist any album belongs to

- [x] Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

#### Further tasks - ONLY CONSIDER THESE ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO THIS POINT
Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

- [x] 1. Edit Artists/Albums
- [x] 2. Delete Artists/Albums
- [x] 3. Find Artists/Albums by their ID
