## The OO CodeClan Karaoke (CCC)
You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build a software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.

<b>Your program should be test driven and should be able to:</b>

<ol>
### Create rooms, songs and guests
<li>Check in guests to rooms</li>
<li>Check out guests from rooms</li>
<li>Add songs to rooms</li>
<li>remove songs in rooms</li>

### Extensions
<li>What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?  </li>
<li>Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.</li>

### Advanced extensions
<li>Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room's playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like "Whoo!")</li>
<li>Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?</li>
<li>Add anything extra you think would be good to have at a karaoke venue!</li>
</ol>
